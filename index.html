<p>Bitcoin has become the talk of tech circles everywhere. However, just like there
are different currencies in the real world, there are different cryptocurrencies
in the digital world. This site aims to provide a fair comparison of these
cryptocurrencies while educating visitors like you of the differences between
each currency.</p>
<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>Each cryptocurrency uses one of two cryptographical algorithms: SHA-256 or
scrypt. For example, Bitcoin uses SHA-256 while Litecoin uses scrypt. Litecoin
went with scrypt, a more memory-intensive algorithm, in an attempt to reduce the
efficiency of GPU-based mining, which dominated Bitcoin mining at the time of
Litecoin&#39;s release. This assumption did not hold true; GPU-mining is currently
the dominant mining method in Litecoin and other scrypt-based cryptocurrencies.</p>

one or more cool new DACs (Distributed Autonomous Communities) before they are
ever implemented. The speculative value of PTS is a subjective mix of three
market perception pillars. These pillars are the market’s assessment of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speculative value of a future DAC share.</li>
<li>The probability that the DAC can and will be successfully fielded.</li>
<li>Confidence that the PTS will map to an equitable share in the
implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>summed across all DACs that announce there intention to honor PTS holders with
shares when launched.</p>

commodities. &quot;Approximately 300 blocks have been premined for the purposes of
giveaway and promotion...&quot;</p>
