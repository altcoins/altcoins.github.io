BitShares PTS is a class of crypto-currency that let you capture a position in
one or more cool new DACs (Distributed Autonomous Communities) before they are
ever implemented. The speculative value of PTS is a subjective mix of three
market perception pillars. These pillars are the marketâ€™s assessment of:

  - The speculative value of a future DAC share.
  - The probability that the DAC can and will be successfully fielded.
  - Confidence that the PTS will map to an equitable share in the
  implementation.

summed across all DACs that announce there intention to honor PTS holders with
shares when launched.
