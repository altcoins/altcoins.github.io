# Altcoins

Bitcoin has become the talk of tech circles everywhere. However, just like there
are different currencies in the real world, there are different cryptocurrencies
in the digital world. This site aims to provide a fair comparison of these
cryptocurrencies while educating visitors like you of the differences between
each currency.

## Algorithm

Each cryptocurrency uses one of two cryptographical algorithms: SHA-256 or
scrypt. For example, Bitcoin uses SHA-256 while Litecoin uses scrypt. Litecoin
went with scrypt, a more memory-intensive algorithm, in an attempt to reduce the
efficiency of GPU-based mining, which dominated Bitcoin mining at the time of
Litecoin's release. This assumption did not hold true; GPU-mining is currently
the dominant mining method in Litecoin and other scrypt-based cryptocurrencies.
